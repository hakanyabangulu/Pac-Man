Pacman

Overview

    This is a terminal-based C maze game where players navigate through predefined levels to reach an exit while collecting bonuses and avoiding traps. The game uses ASCII characters for rendering and ANSI color codes for visual enhancement. It features multiple levels, a scoring system, and a high score tracker.
